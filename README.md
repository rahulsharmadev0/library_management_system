# Library Management System

A comprehensive command-line based Library Management System built in Java that provides functionality for managing books, members, and book issuing operations.

## Features

### ðŸ“š Book Inventory Management
- âœ… Add new books to the library
- âœ… Delete books from inventory
- âœ… Update book details
- âœ… Search books by title, author, or ID
- âœ… List all books in the library
- âœ… Sort books by title, author, or publication year

### ðŸ‘¥ Member/User Management
- âœ… Register new library members
- âœ… Update member information
- âœ… Delete member records
- âœ… Search members by ID, name, email, or phone
- âœ… List all registered members

### ðŸ“– Book Issuing & Returning (In Development)
- ðŸ”„ Issue books to members
- ðŸ”„ Return books to the library
- ðŸ”„ Track issue and return dates
- ðŸ”„ Prevent issuing already issued books

## Design Patterns Used

This project demonstrates the implementation of several design patterns:

- **Singleton Design Pattern** - For managing single instances of services
- **Factory Method Design Pattern** - For creating objects without specifying exact classes
- **Command Design Pattern** - For encapsulating requests as objects
- **Strategy Design Pattern** - For defining family of algorithms
- **Generic Class Design Pattern** - For type-safe collections and operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Command line terminal

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd library_management_system
   ```

2. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   javac -cp src -d bin src/**/*.java
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   java -cp bin Main
   ```

### Using VS Code Tasks

If you're using VS Code, you can use the predefined task to compile the project:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run `Tasks: Run Task`
3. Select `Compile Java Project`

## Usage

Upon running the application, you'll be presented with a main menu offering the following options:

1. **Book Inventory Management**
   - Manage your library's book collection
   - Add, update, delete, and search for books

2. **Member Management**
   - Handle library member operations
   - Register, update, and manage member information

3. **Book Issuing & Returning** (Coming Soon)
   - Issue books to members
   - Track and manage book returns

## Key Components

### Core Entities
- **Book**: Represents a book with ISBN, title, author, and other details
- **Member**: Represents a library member with personal information
- **Option**: Generic option class for menu selections

### Services
- **LocalDB**: Generic file-based database service
- **BookService**: Business logic for book operations
- **MemberService**: Business logic for member operations

### UI Framework
- **Navigator**: Handles application navigation
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates all user actions
- **TableFormatter**: Generic table formatting utility

## Data Storage

The application uses CSV-based file storage:
- `book.dat` - Stores book information
- `member.dat` - Stores member information

Data is automatically persisted when modifications are made.

## Development Roadmap

- [ ] Complete Book Issuing & Returning functionality
- [ ] Implement automation/code generation via annotations
- [ ] Optimize command package structure
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Implement data validation and error handling
- [ ] Add configuration management
